How to cook stuffed cabbage rolls:

Disassemble the cabbage into leaves. Place in a bowl and season with salt. Boil the kettle. Pour boiling water over the leaves, cover and leave for 15-20 minutes.

For minced meat, mince the meat. Minced meat can be used in the store.

Rinse the rice well and cook in plenty of salted water until half cooked for 10-12 minutes. Then put the rice in a colander and rinse with cold water.

Peel, wash and grate the carrots.

Peel the onion, wash and cut into cubes.

Preheat a frying pan, pour in vegetable oil. Fry onions and carrots over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1-2 minutes.

Add rice to the minced meat, season with salt and pepper.

Wash greens and chop finely.

Add the egg, frying and herbs to the minced meat. Mix well.

Cut large cabbage leaves in half. Put a small amount of minced meat on the prepared cabbage leaves and wrap in the form of an envelope. Fold into a cauldron.

Prepare the sauce for the stuffed cabbage. Boil the kettle, dilute the sour cream with water and tomato paste (150 g sour cream per 0.5 l of water), salt. Pour cabbage rolls. Simmer cabbage rolls at low boil, covered, until minced meat is ready, 50-60 minutes.

Bon Appetit!
